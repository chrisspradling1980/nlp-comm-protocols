NLP integration with messaging or communication protocols

# NLP Communication Protocols

A modular framework for integrating Natural Language Processing (NLP) with communication protocols. This project explores how machines interpret, respond to, and route human language across messaging systems—designed with empathy, transparency, and adaptability in mind.

## Project Goals

- Build NLP modules that parse, classify, and respond to user input
- Interface with communication protocols (e.g., email, chat, custom messaging layers)
- Enable modular plug-ins for different NLP engines or models
- Explore ethical and empathetic language handling in digital systems

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repo:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nlp-comm-protocols.git
   cd nlp-comm-protocols

2. Install dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the framework
    bash
    python src/main.py

4. (Optional) Use setup.sh for Termux-specific setup.

Mobile-Friendly Notes

- Designed to run on Termux with minimal dependencies
- Modular structure allows lightweight testing and development
- Use file manager to offload assets to Google Drive if needed

Design Philosophy

This project is part of a broader initiative to make digital communication more human. It emphasizes clarity, empathy, and ethical language processing—bridging the gap between technical protocols and emotional nuance.
